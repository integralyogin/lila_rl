# Lila RL Data-Driven Architecture Analysis

## Current Architecture Assessment

The codebase follows a roguelike game architecture with a component-based entity system. Key architecture elements include:

1. **Entity-Component System**: Modular components that can be attached to entities, creating a flexible composition-based approach.
2. **Data-Driven Content**: JSON files define monsters, items, maps, and spells.
3. **System-Based Logic**: Separate systems process specific game aspects (combat, AI, rendering, etc.)
4. **Event-Based Communication**: Systems communicate via events rather than tight coupling.

### Data Layer
- **JSON Data Files**: Items, monsters, spells, and maps defined externally
- **EntityFactory**: Translates JSON data into game entities with appropriate components
- **Component Structure**: Properties directly mapped from data files

### Entity-Component System
- **Base Components**: Position, Renderable, BlocksMovement
- **Combat Components**: Stats, Health, Attack abilities
- **Magic Components**: ManaPool, SpellCaster
- **Item Components**: Inventory, Equipment, Usable
- **Social Components**: Dialogue, Shop

### Systems
- **AI System**: Processes entities with AI components, using behavior templates from JSON
- **Combat System**: Handles attacks, damage calculation, equipment effects
- **Spell System**: Implements various spell types with some data-driven aspects
- **Targeting System**: For selecting spell and ability targets
- **Rendering System**: Displays entities on screen

## Comparison to Data-Driven RPGs

### Caves of Qud
- **Similarity**: Component-based entity system, JSON data files
- **Difference**: CoQ uses a more advanced mutation/modification system
- **Inspiration**: Their object system allows objects to be defined by their properties and mutations

### Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead
- **Similarity**: JSON definition of items, monsters, and maps
- **Difference**: C:DDA uses a more comprehensive JSON schema with inheritance
- **Inspiration**: Their item template system with inheritance would allow more complex item hierarchies

### Dwarf Fortress
- **Similarity**: Complex AI behaviors, detailed world representation
- **Difference**: DF uses a more simulation-heavy approach with interconnected systems
- **Inspiration**: More complex interaction between systems (temperature, materials, fluids)

### Morrowind
- **Similarity**: Spell system with different effect types
- **Difference**: Morrowind uses a more flexible effect component system for spells
- **Inspiration**: Spell creation system that combines effect components

## Current Data-Driven Strengths
1. JSON-defined entities (monsters, items, spells)
2. Component-based architecture allowing composition
3. Separation of data and logic
4. System-based processing of components

## Opportunities for Improvement

### Entity Template System
- Implement inheritance for entity templates
- Allow overriding specific properties
- Support composition of templates

### Enhanced Spell System
- Move spell implementations to data rather than code
- Define spell effects as composable components
- Create a pipeline for processing spell effects

### Dynamic Behavior Tree AI
- Define AI behaviors entirely in data
- Create behavior building blocks that can be combined
- Allow conditional actions and sequences

### Material System
- Define materials and their properties in data
- Implement material effects on items and environment
- Create interactions between materials and effects

## Recommended Architecture Model

The game architecture most closely resembles **Caves of Qud**, with its component-based entity system and JSON data files. To further improve the data-driven nature, consider:

1. **Adopting CDDA's inheritance system** for entity templates
2. **Implementing Morrowind's effect component system** for spells
3. **Creating a more simulation-based approach** for world interactions (like DF)
4. **Adding behavior trees defined in data** for more flexible AI

By combining these approaches, Lila RL could become even more data-driven, allowing for rich content creation with minimal code changes.

## Next Steps
1. Refactor the spell system to use composable effects defined in data
2. Implement template inheritance for entity definitions
3. Create a more comprehensive behavior tree system for AI
4. Design a material property system for more complex interactions
