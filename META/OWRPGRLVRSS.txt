    Game Analysis, Game Dev, Game Concepts

--- WHY:
    the new mission statement

--- OLD MISSION STATEMENT:
    so the goal is to create an fun, challenging (hooking) RPG that will make a strong profit and achieve a positive response such that it will go on to be expanded beyond its currently limited scope, ideally this process can continue indefinitely until it lives as open world RPG VR.

--- NEW PRIORITIES:
--- INSPIRATION:
    checkout MTG, TOME(items, bosses), WOW(spells, bosses), D&D (spells and classes), ("vg") for all my favorite shit. also add tactics in there?

ESSENTIAL:
<h2 id="stats"> - STATS - </h2>
    wisdom ::: increases xp in some way, resist magic, resist evil, resist corruption, protection illusion, improve white magic potency, + MP, + WP
    willpower ::: increases gain in some way, extends magic duration, + WP, extand range of some spells, psychic resistance?, psychic potency, sorcery potency?, MP?
    intelligence ::: increases xp gain in some way, learning, hacking, tinkering, robotics, some form of resistance, MP?
    strength ::: damage/power, heavy weapons requirements. resistance of some sort
    vitality ::: resistance of some sort, HP
    dexterity ::: evasion, speed, crits, accuracy
    others ::: HP, MP, Time Bar?, perception/awareness?, >and 1 hidden stat (agro?), speed?, status effects,  equipment effects, temperature?, fire elemental > void elemental.. slow > frozen.

<h2 id="class1"> - CLASSES (GENERAL): - </h2>
    white wizard - white / holy / light magic/miracles - priest
    rogue / assassin / ninja / archer?(speed, tricks, disrupt/disable, criticals)
    knight / samurai / guard:defensive, protective, thick. strong.
    psychic / mindcraft
    time / space (gravity)
    dark / necrotic / blood / corruption
    elemental (air, water, fire, earth/material)
    barbarism / savagery
    Cartographer, Engineer(based on any skill(each skill is a skill tree?))
    others? like a standard thing everyone would borrow from?

<h2 id="magick"> - MAGICK: - </h2>
    SPACE/TIME ::: phase(att/def), gravity, haste, interrupt(counter)(dirtyy as a gambit!), revert(slows time around you to speed yourself up), blink, teleport
    AIR ::: increase speed, air cutter, levitation, double jump, fly, summon air familiar
    ARCANE ::: arcane blast, arcane beam, arcane turret, arcane forms, summon arcane spirit
    FIRE ::: flame wave, summon fire vortex, fly(obsenely hard to do)
    ILLUSION:
    ALTERATION ::: increase stat(ego projection), alter property(for weapons or w/e), make permanent(must have HEAVY costs esp for persons), something that lets you add tails or wings or arms?
    SUMMONING:
    EARTH ::: summon earth giant(based on environment?), can cast lightly other elements? high elemental resistances?, shape earth-yay!
    WHITE ::: protection, warding, light, revive, dispel, light-beam, exorcise, boosting? bless? summon avatar, identify?, true sight
    PSYCHIC ::: sense consciousness, mind blast, psychic protection, dominate(linked with dark?)
- mind blast: go as deep as you can and destroy as much as possible. full hit is "you destroyed its sense of self, it has no idea what is going on."
- psychokinetic crush and strangle: attempt to crush and strangle the target with telekinetic force. full hit is "the enemy could not resist your crushing force and has been repeatedly folded in on itself, in a quick but truly grueling death. there isnt much left.". Lesser hits could be physical crippling and paralysis.
- dominate: unmericisely dominate the mind of the target, effectively turning it into a hijacked npc that will mindlessly follow orders. full hit is "you have dominated the target, your victim has been helplessly enslaved against their will." Repeated use opens dark magic tree?
    NECROMANCY/DARK ::: paralyzed aura, drain stat, drain health/mana, drain life, corrupt, drain time, poison cloud, compell, raise dead, summon demon/spirit, possess/dominate,  - 6 people sacrificing their lives and many others to summon a horrid evil, which immediately requires food.

<h2 id="skills"> - SKILLS AND SKILL TREES - </h2>
    concentration(reduces magic time costs, increases learning speed), meditation(increase MP/WP rate), alchemy, kata, 
- cartography
    diablo 2 sorceress has 10 skills per tree, ie 30 skills for sorceress. 
    there is something i need to do with my class set up because elemental for example would take 40 and holy only 10. 
    stat requirements for particular skills. like mindcontrol or most high magic probably requires ridiculous willpower. but is it better to add requirements in the skill allocation itself or in other mechanic, such that without high willpower, one wont have enough MP to cast the spell in the first place. also adding requirements is extra work. 
    a cooldown system?

    Spells(is this not under skills):
    chainlightning? or recurring lightning? 
    regen, 
    check MTG for inspiration 
    mirror image? 
    self-destruct? see mels fire mage build

--- FIGHTS / BATTLES

<h2 id="mechanics"> - MECHANICS - </h2>
    GAMBITS / technical points ::: requires practicing the thing enough times until you can do it automatically? or by points or spell? by simple coding?

    COMBAT MECHANICS ::: shooting the foot, combos (interupt with attack while backstepping or autoshoot w autoretreat w autododge)

    this section was added for the question of... 
    making the victories worth while? not just like

    funness? because the PC's start at level 100, how to integrate some form of progression which is the backbone of RPG enjoyment? the grinding has been taking out which is a miracle.

--- TODO:
    todo list located under 't:Game Dev'

    Todo (update?):
    do research into other games. figuring out their mechanics. check out TOME for stats. ADOM. 
    d2 for items 
    check out wow for spells and bosses. 
    link and synthesize with other videogames pages("vg")? 
    organize the vidya page? find some inspiration in there? 
    write as a means to find inspiration? 
    class descriptions, spell descriptions etc. mtg metatext 
    check unsorted, questions 
    play like 10 different mmos?

    General/Overview?:

    TIME:
    100 bosses will take about 2-3 weeks? at 5-7 bosses per day? but for the prototype for kickstarter we dont need anywhere near as many bosses. more important would be like 15 solid engaging Fights.

    Problems:
    staying within a practicable scope. 
    staying inspired. to this point its probably best to design all the dopest shit first.

FEATURES:
    life, npcs, buildings, artifacts, players, AI, nature
    portals
    entrance to inside temple of time
    items:Savitri

QUESTIONS:
    how many equipment slots should there be?
    kickstarter chance %? estimated return range?
    is this current design viable?
    making the victories worth while? making the game hooking.
    how long do I expect it will take to roughly design the game? how long to design a fight?
    how can heroes blah blah blah?
    races?
    what do you think about for drewRPG: the idea of being able to steal a bosses item once he is weakened then equip it in the match? on that note would be changing around inventory while in a match?

--- WISHLIST
    group casting 
    polymorph spell
    unsorted

    races?
    demo for kickstarter? 
    shrines in ultima, as a means perhaps of classing, or shifting from peasant to hero to avatar or something.
OLD PRIORITIES:
    design one solid engaging Fight.
    create company name
    respond to drews proposal
    create a proposal for dad? or update him / discuss with him?
    figure out scope?
    make a todo list?
    what should i work on next?
