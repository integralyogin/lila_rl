# Game Ideas

## Core Design Philosophies

### Game Structure
- **Games Within a Game (2021-08-05)**: Implement math worlds and other planes of existence within the main game
- **Turing Completeness (2021-08-05)**: Aim for systems with sufficient complexity to be Turing complete
- **Character Spawn**: Game starts at various temples where a higher soul (human soul) incarnates into a game being
- **Non-Linearity**: Allow multiple paths and approaches to areas and challenges (unlike Unepic's linearity)
- **Multiple Solutions**: Design obstacles that can be overcome through various means (e.g., giant rocks can be destroyed with strength, hammers, magic, explosives, or moved with supernatural strength)
- **Customization**: Extensive starting customization with room for growth
- **Accessibility**: Don't lock important elements like spells behind late-game progression
- **In-Game Knowledge**: Implement a library system where players can learn about the world
- **Exploration Freedom**: Draw inspiration from Zelda's joy of exploration and climbing to high places
- **No Level Caps**: Replace arbitrary level restrictions with skill/stat requirements
- **Learning Systems**: Multiple ways to acquire skills (self-training, mentors, books, shrines)

### Gameplay Elements
- **Shopkeepers**: Occasional ultra-valuable/unique items, layaway system (10% down holds items)
- **Magic Systems**: Include mark/recall spells, but make them challenging to acquire
- **Permadeath**: High-risk, high-reward decisions with permanent consequences
- **Legacy System**: Items created by legendary characters remain in the world
- **Inheritance**: Allow passing items to new characters through wills/banks/heirs
- **Shrines**: Create pilgrimage destinations that provide boosts under certain conditions
- **Arena**: Two modes - non-lethal with money rewards, and lethal with gear rewards
- **Wishing**: Dragon Ball-inspired wish system with "wish cost" for powerful effects
- **Summoner Class**: Safety advantage in a permadeath world
- **Castle Siege**: Option to overthrow the king through various means
- **ASCII Graphics**: Initially use ASCII for simplicity, with potential mod support like Dwarf Fortress
- **Combat Mechanics**: Targeted strikes (feet, head), combat-altering injuries
- **Environmental Effects**: Wind magic more powerful at high altitudes
- **Social Features**: In-game marriage and relationship building
- **Mobility Magic**: Flying, jumping, teleportation with strategic requirements
- **The Abyss**: Dark, cramped area requiring light/dark magic or high will/faith to navigate
- **Alternative Characters**: Robot option with unique abilities and challenges
- **Regeneration**: Make health regeneration valuable and rare, not the default state
- **Moral Choices**: Strong temptation to go evil balanced with consequences
- **Soul System**: Spiritual progression that persists beyond character death

## Class Systems

### Alchemist
- Potions offering both temporary and permanent stat boosts
- Drawbacks to potion consumption (weakness after effects wear off)
- Limits on potion consumption based on character's constitution
- Multiple ways to learn recipes (study, teaching, experimentation)
- Special potions: gain attributes, skill gain, literacy, immortality
- High-level transmutation abilities
- Hidden alchemist guild with powerful guildmaster

### Assassin
- Stealth progression: walk silent → run silent, hide → stealth
- Fatal blow (requires anatomy skill)
- Backstab
- Poison creation and use (synergy with alchemy)

### Dark Time Wizard
- Sanctuary entrapment spells
- Temporal manipulation
- Can potentially counter immortality

### Necromancer
- "Decrepify" spell that drains stats until death
- Mind control (temporary or permanent)
- Death touch
- Death plague spell (extremely rare/difficult to cast)
- Raising undead

### Absolute Vampire
- Sylar-like ability to steal skills, traits, qualities
- Potential counter to immortality

### Other Classes/Specializations
- Monk: Light armor, unarmed combat, chi abilities
- Phase attack abilities (bypassing defenses)
- Holy Knights: Relentless pursuers if king is killed

## World Systems

### Information Systems
- Multiple methods to acquire information (library, NPCs, players)
- Time Wizard's "time scout" spell for reconnaissance

### Morality Systems
- Piety rewards: soul experience, karmic benefits
- Good/evil balance counter affecting reincarnation
- Evil incentives increase as good proliferates

### Defensive Systems
- Tower defense elements for cities
- Bottleneck strategies
- Home defense: turrets, androids, companions, traps
- Security options: physical barriers, magic wards, biometric locks

### Quests & Storylines
- **Global Immortality Quest**: Kill Death to bring immortality to all
- **Bring Back Death**: Counter-quest to restore mortality
- **Guild Rebirth**: Reincarnate into established guilds
- **Universal Rebirth**: Server-wide reset when good triumphs completely

### World Generation
- Dwarf Fortress-inspired procedural generation
- Living environments that respond to player actions
- Light vs. darkness as territorial mechanic

### Item Systems
- Stealing mechanics: nearly all items can be stolen except cursed/bound items
- Item destruction spells and mechanics
- Scrying orbs to locate specific items/people
- Divine will prevents wishing for god-tier items

### Magic Systems
- Server-wide magic unlocking
- Pledges/vows for special abilities
- Power sites (shrines, high places) enhancing specific magic

### Home & Territory
- Food cultivation
- Monster attacks
- Security systems: traps, turrets, magic wards
- Enslavement processes for captured creatures
- Torture chambers and breaking mechanisms
- Enhancement facilities for training/modifying captives
- Blood farms for rare creature types

### World Exploration
- NPC cartographers mapping the darkness
- Lightposts expanding safe territory
- Reclaiming areas from darkness
- Terraforming and ecological development

## Game Potential
- Dual roles: Play as Gods (world-builders) or as Mortals (adventurers)
- Ultimate evolution into open world RPG VR AI
- Beautiful world emerging from darkness through player efforts

## Failures of Other Games to Learn From
- Hollow Knight, Dead Cells, Unepic lacking progression depth
- Need to combine Morrowind/Ultima Online/FF3 progression with Morrowind's acrobatics
