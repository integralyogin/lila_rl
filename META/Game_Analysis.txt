--- NEW
  advanced D&D:eye of the beholder
    just smoked but so far this game is really good. 2 particular notes.
      movement and attacking, its tricky at first but you can get free hits on monsters.. very fucking sick.
      no hp info.. very interesting. its annoying because I want to know who has the highest max and put them in front but I can only guess. for that reason im going to start over and keep track. since it only tells you in the beginning. it doesnt give u info on race either seriously fucked.
      what sucks is no magic yet. I havent figured it out at least. but some games are like this. oh my lord.. you have to "petition" for spells and then once you know them... your characters autocast while resting. brooooo.
